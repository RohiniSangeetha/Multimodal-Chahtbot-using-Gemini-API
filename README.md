# Multimodal-Chahtbot-using-Gemini-API

This project introduces a multimodal chatbot developed using the Gemini API
for seamless integration of text and image processing. The Gemini API serves as
a central component, facilitating efficient communication between the chatbot's
Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision modules. By harnessing
advanced Natural Language Understanding techniques and state-of-the-art
Computer Vision algorithms, the chatbot effectively interprets user queries and
analyzes uploaded images to generate contextually relevant responses.The
integration of the Gemini API enables the chatbot to handle diverse user inputs,
supporting both text-based and image-based communication channels. This
project showcases the potential of multimodal chatbot systems empowered by the
Gemini API to enhance user engagement and improve interaction in various
applications.
